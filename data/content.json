    "about": [
      "I am a Data Scientist with a strong MLOps and cloud foundation, focused on building production-ready machine learning systems rather than standalone models.",
      "My work spans the full ML lifecycle: data ingestion, feature engineering, model development, deployment, monitoring, and iteration. I recently led the development of an industrial predictive-maintenance system, combining interpretable ML models with a real-time monitoring dashboard to support operational decision-making in manufacturing environments.",
      "I am particularly interested in the reliability and scalability of ML systems. My recent training and hands-on work emphasize Docker, Kubernetes, Linux, GitHub Actions, Terraform (Infrastructure as Code), and AWS, enabling reproducible pipelines, automated deployments, and maintainable cloud infrastructure.",
      "With a background that bridges mechanical engineering and data science, I bring a systems-level mindset to ML problems—grounding models in physical intuition, operational constraints, and real-world impact. I aim to build ML products that are not only accurate, but deployable, observable, and trusted by end users."
